.TH eth-info 1

.SH NAME
eth-info - Return key metrics from the current state of the EVM network.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBeth-info\fP [ -p \fIrpc_provider\fP ] [ \fIkey\fP ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBeth-info\fP reports statistics from the current state of the EVM network:

.EX
$ eth-info
Block: 1024478
Gas price: 1000000000
.EE

An individual data item may be specified using the \fIkey\fP positional argument:

.EX
$ eth-info block
Block: 1024478
$ eth-info --raw gas_price
1000000000
.EE

.SS OPTIONS

.TP
\fB-0\fP
Omit newline to output

.TP
\fB-c \fI\fIconfig_dir\fP\fP, \fB--config \fI\fIconfig_dir\fP\fP
Load configuration files from given directory. All files with an .ini extension will be loaded, of which all must contain valid ini file data.

.TP
\fB--dumpconfig \fI\fIformat\fP\fP
Output configuration settings rendered from environment and inputs. Valid arguments are \fIini\fP for ini file output, and \fIenv\fP for environment variable output. See \fBCONFIGURATION\fP.

.TP
\fB--env-prefix\fP
Environment prefix for variables to overwrite configuration. Example: If \fB--env-prefix\fP is set to \fBFOO\fP then configuration variable \fBBAR_BAZ\fP would be set by environment variable \fBFOO_BAZ_BAR\fP. Also see \fBENVIRONMENT\fP.

.TP
\fB--height\fP
Block height at which to query state for. Does not apply to transactions.

.TP
\fB-n \fI\fInamespace\fP\fP, \fB--namespace \fI\fInamespace\fP\fP
Load given configuration namespace. Configuration will be loaded from the immediate configuration subdirectory with the same name.

.TP
\fB--no-logs\fP
Turn of logging completely. Negates \fB-v\fP and \fB-vv\fP

.TP
\fB-p\fP, \fB--rpc-provider\fP
Fully-qualified URL of RPC provider. Overrides the \fIRPC_PROVIDER\fP configuration setting.

.TP
\fB--raw\fP
Produce output most optimized for machines.

.TP
\fB--rpc-dialect\fP
RPC backend dialect. If specified it \fImay\fP help with encoding and decoding issues. Overrides the \fIRPC_DIALECT\fP configuration setting.

.TP
\fB--seq\fP
Use numeric sequencial jsonrpc query ids. Useful for buggy server implementations who expects such.

.TP
\fB-u\fP, \fB--unsafe\fP
Allow addresses that do not pass checksum.

.TP
\fB-v\fP
Verbose. Show logs for important state changes.

.TP
\fB-vv\fP
Very verbose. Show logs with debugging information.

.SH CONFIGURATION

All configuration settings may be overriden both by environment variables, or by overriding settings with the contents of ini-files in the directory defined by the \fB-c\fP option.

The active configuration, with values assigned from environment and arguments, can be output using the \fB--dumpconfig\fP \fIformat\fP option. Note that entries having keys prefixed with underscore (e.g. _SEQ) are not actual configuration settings, and thus cannot be overridden with environment variables.

To refer to a configuration setting by environment variables, the \fIsection\fP and \fIkey\fP are concatenated together with an underscore, and transformed to upper-case. For example, the configuration variable \fIFOO_BAZ_BAR\fP refers to an ini-file entry as follows:

.EX
[foo]
bar_baz = xyzzy
.EE

In the \fBENVIRONMENT\fP section below, the relevant configuration settings for this tool is listed along with a short description of its meaning.

Some configuration settings may also be overriden by command line options. Also note that the use of the \fB-n\fP and \fB--env-prefix\fP options affect how environment and configuration is read. The effects of options on how configuration settings are affective is described in the respective \fBOPTIONS\fP section.

.SH ENVIRONMENT


.TP
\fIRPC_DIALECT\fP
Enables translations of EVM node specific formatting and response codes.

.TP
\fIRPC_PROVIDER\fP
Fully-qualified URL to the RPC endpoint of the blockchain node.
